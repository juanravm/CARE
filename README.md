## Clinical Assessment of Risk in Endometrial Cancer (CARE)

**CARE** is a clinical prognostic modeling project for **Endometrial Cancer**, focused on patients defined as a **Non-Specific Molecular Profile (NMSP)**.

The goal of the project is to develop a **clinical decision-support tool** that integrates routinely available **clinicopathological variables**, with optional molecular features, to improve **prognosis prediction** in real-world clinical practice.

---

## Project goals

- Build robust **survival prediction models** using clinical data  
- Evaluate and compare classical and machine-learning–based survival models  
- Prioritize **clinical interpretability and usability**  
- Develop an **interactive tool** for day-to-day use by clinicians  

---

## Data

The project uses:
- Clinicopathological and molecular variables collected in clinical care by Clinapsis
- Time-to-event outcomes with censoring (e.g. OS, DFS)  

---

## Methods (planned)

- Survival analysis with censoring-aware models:
  - Cox models with regularization
  - Tree-based and boosting survival models
- Cross-validation and proper survival metrics (e.g. C-index)
- Feature selection focused on clinical robustness
- Model explainability for clinical adoption

## Intended use

This project is designed as a **research and clinical decision-support tool**.  
It is **not** intended to replace clinical judgment.
